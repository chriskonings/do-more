# Find & share hidden gems in cities

I was googling too much trying to find places to go when I travelled, review sites and "top X" articles just weren't cutting it for me, so I decided to build an app for people to collect, share and discover places from other people that had been there.

### To Do

#### Features
- [ ] Add "been there" tagging, to tell when someone has actually been to the place and how many.
- [ ] Add "gem" sharing with other users
- [ ] Add "discover gems" feature
- [ ] Sort "gems" by location in "my gems"
- [ ] Add dropdown to filter by location in "my gems"

#### Tech
- [ ] Deploy to server
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (Jenkins) - [Dev -> Staging -> Production]
- [ ] Migrate (from Google Maps) to Mapbox
- [ ] Migrate (from Firebase) to MongoDB
